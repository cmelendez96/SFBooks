Proposal
Book Collectors is a simple app that can be used to keep track of all the books that you've read as well as find book stores near you so that you can keep
reading and building your list!

Must have features:
Map that shows users location and automatically shows local book stores based on the users location
List that shows books users have read and includes the date completed
Constraints that keep the design consistent throughout different devices and if device is flipped

Nice to have feature:
